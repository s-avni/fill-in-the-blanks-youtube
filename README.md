# Fill-in-the-blanks Worksheet Generator 

If you'd like to improve your listening comprehension skills in a foreign language, use this website to generate a fill-in-the-blanks worksheet from a YouTube video of the foreign language that you like.

## About the project

Fill-in-the-blank worksheets are great tools for improving listening comprehension skills in a foreign language, but there are a limited number of worksheets available online. This tool lets you create worksheets from any YouTube videos you like: simply find a video with captions in the foreign language that you are learning, and paste the url in the search box.

The website is implemented with Flask on the backend and React on the frontend.
